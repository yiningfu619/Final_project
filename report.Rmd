# Introduction:
This dataset includes comprehensive data for the estimation of obesity levels 
in individuals from the countries of Mexico, Peru, and Colombia, providing 
valuable insights based on various factors such as their eating habits, 
physical condition, lifestyle choices, and other health-related behaviors. 
The information collected aims to offer a deeper understanding of the 
prevalence of obesity in these regions, potentially aiding in the development 
of tailored public health interventions and policies to combat obesity and 
improve overall health outcomes across these nations.

The dataset consists of 17 attributes and 2,111 records, each labeled with the 
class variable "NObesity" (Obesity Level), which enables the classification of 
data into categories such as Insufficient Weight, Normal Weight, Overweight 
Level I, Overweight Level II, Obesity Type I, Obesity Type II, 
and Obesity Type III. 

**Mass body index** = $\frac{weight}{height*height}$

Underweight refers to people whose mass body weight index is less 
than 18.5. Normal weight people have a mass body weight index of 
18.5 to 24.9, Overweight people have a mass body weight index of 25 to 29.9, 
Obesity I 30.0 to 34.9, Obesity II 35.0 to 39.9, and Obesity III Higher than 40.

# Descriptive Analysis

## Tabular analysis

Characteristics of the `r nrow(data)` viruses from the Obesity database are
displayed in the table below. This table summarizes the relationship between 
obesity level and daily water intake. At the same time, the table also gives 
the median height and the median number of meals eaten per day. 
It summarizes the data on daily water intake for people with or without a 
family history of obesity and whether they smoke and their daily water intake.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="60%", tabe1}
table_one<-readRDS("tables/table_one.rds")

```

## Graphical analysis

The bar plot below shows the distribution of obesity levels in the dataset. 
The most common categories are "Overweight Level I" and "Overweight Level III". 
This indicates that the prevalence of overweight individuals is high in the 
dataset.

```{r fig-one, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figures/figure_one.png"))
```

Below we report a scatter plot of NCP(number of main meals) as a function of 
number of Height, to find out whether taller people eat more meals per day.
It shows a linear relationship between obesity level and NCP,so we can conclude 
that people with high obesity level eat more than others. We also see that 
people who are taller tend to have a higher obesity level but does not seems to
eat more main meals than others.

```{r fig-two, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%"}
